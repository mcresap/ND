/* My program 3 is supposed to solve for the roots of quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.
Users can enter the coefficients a, b, and c of their equation and the program will return the roots. 
	The program first introduces new variables a, b, c, x1, and x2 as real numbers to be inputted 
or solved for. The user is then asked to input their a, b, and c values and these inputted numbers 
become the assigned value of a, b, and c. Then the program solves the quadratic equation using
multiplication, division, and the sqrt and pow functions. The solutions to the quadratic equation are 
assigned to be the values of x1 and x2. Finally, the program displays the roots (x1 and x2) to the user.
	I checked the program for correctness by checking different quadratics that I knew the roots for. 
Then, I checked more complex equations involving real numbers/decimals with my calculator. Each 
equation I checked produced correct results and the only cases that produced incorrect results were 
those when I tried to input a fraction as a, b, or c. I think that it must not be possible to input 
a fraction as a variable's value.*/
