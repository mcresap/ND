/* 1.The user can run this graph program to view a cosine graph using ASCII art. The graph 
is turned so the x axis runs vertically down and each line of the graph displas the x an 
y values for that line for the user. The program uses "#" to display the y values but 
rounds to the nearest whole number so is not very accurate but gives the user a sense for 
what the graph looks like. The program also displayes the max and min values that occur on 
the domain displayed along with the graphed function in the beginning along with 
the x values at these points.
2. This program starts by displaying what function it will be graphing. The program uses 
double for the variables x, y, the max and min, and the x values for the max and min.
The program use for loops to graph the function and if statements to find the max and min
and x values at the max and min. The first for loop starts at x=0 and goes until the max x
 value of 17, incrementing by .2 every time it runs the loop. Then the program uses the 
cosine equation to change the y value and, using iomanip formatting, displays x and y at 
that point rounded to 2 decimal places. Then the for loop 
includes an if statement loop that records the max and min values of y and what x is at 
these points into variables. Then there is a for loop also inside the original for loop 
that displays # until it has displayed enough to equal the y value for that line/that 
iteration of the loop. Then a new line is created and the for loop runs again (until 
x=17). The program finishes by displaying the min and max values with their accompanying x 
values.
3. I verified that the output was correct by graphing the function I chose on a calculator 
and comparing it to the graph outputted by my program. I also calculated the min and max 
values and checked the x values at the min and max on the domain I chose to ensure they 
were the same ones calculated and displayed in my program.*/
